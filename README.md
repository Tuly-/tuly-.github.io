# Intentions
In a world of framework-only sites, I'd like to rediscover the power of the Vanilla tools provided by the Web. <br/>

# Description
Portfolio website made only of the goods of the Web (<i>Vanilla</i>): <b>HTML5, CSS3 and JS</b>.

# Author
Andrea Tulimiero

# Notes
Feel free to take whatever you want, hope something will help you. <br/>
If you take lots of code a citation would be appreciated :D !
