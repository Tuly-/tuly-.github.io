# Intentions
In a world of framework only sites, I'd like to rediscover the power of the Vanilla tools provided by the Web. <br/>

# Description
Portfolio website made only of the goods of the Web (<i>Vanilla</i>): <b>HTML5, CSS3 and JS</b>. <br/>
Feel free to take whatever you want, hope something will help you.
