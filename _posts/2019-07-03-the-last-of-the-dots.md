If you want to transform your [twitter.com](https://twitter.com.) in a *blank page*, or log out from [youtube.com](https://youtube.com.), you're just "a dot away".

P.S.:
Some browsers correct the url address of [youtube.com](https://youtube.com.), so the magic won't happen. If you are not logged out, it means that either the url has been corrected or the "ambiguity" has been fixed. If you want to manually try what I'll be talking about, visit [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) and then add a "." at the end of the url -- this should do the trick.

# The long story
I have to admit that the beginning of this article is somewhat of a "clickbait", but it is nice to first experience yourself what we will discuss about.
Since the beginning of the internet, we think of website addresses in the form of something like "foo.com" or "bar.net".
Well, strictly speaking, these are not 100% valid domain names.
In fact, a domain like "foo.com" is a so called Partial Qualified Domain Name, or relative domain name, meaning that it does not describe the full path to reach it starting from the root servers.
On the other hand, an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name), or absolute domain name, do contain all the path nodes needed to traverse the three hierarchy of the DNS (Domain Name System).

# A regression on DNS
If you're quite familiar with how DNS works, you can skip this part an go directly to the next one; otherwise, I'll briefly drive you through what DNS is and how it works.

Backs in the days of [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), servers where solely identified by their unique IP address.
