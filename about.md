{{ site.description }}

I've worked as a **full-stack web** developer for years, using _Django_, _Boostratp_ and _Vue.js_.  
As a hobbyist, Iâ€™ve also built **mobile** apps for _Android_, some of them as clients for **IoT** projects involving _Arduino_.  

I truly believe in the power of Open Source, and when I'm able to, I love contributing to open source projects.  
I'm quite active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3943047/andrea-tulimiero) as well.
